make sure that all the elemnts between 0 to k-1 should be present in array secondly,

remember if you encounter element equal to k then you need to remove it, in doing so you can add other elemnt which is not present in range 0 to k-1
means you can do 2 operations together in a single operation thats why we took the max as answer.
